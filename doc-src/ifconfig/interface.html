<p> Individual interfaces are represented as instances of the Interface class. </p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

	<h3>Interface()</h3>

	<p>The Interface class should never be instantiated by the user. Interface
	instances can be retrieved using IFConfig, discussed in the previous
	section.</p>

	<h3>flags</h3>

	<p> The <b>flags</b> attribute is used both to set and retrieve interface
	flags. That is, values assigned to this attribute, will automatically be
	set on the interface as well. The following flags are available:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>IFF_UP</li>
			<li>IFF_BROADCAST</li>
			<li>IFF_DEBUG</li>
			<li>IFF_LOOPBACK</li>
			<li>IFF_POINTOPOINT</li>
			<li>IFF_NOTRAILERS</li>
			<li>IFF_RUNNING</li>
			<li>IFF_NOARP</li>
			<li>IFF_PROMISC</li>
			<li>IFF_ALLMULTI</li>
			<li>IFF_OACTIVE</li>
			<li>IFF_SIMPLEX</li>
			<li>IFF_LINK0</li>
			<li>IFF_LINK1</li>
			<li>IFF_LINK2</li>
			<li>IFF_MULTICAST</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Name</h3>

	<p> The interface name. </p>


	<h3>Iftype</h3>

	<p> The <b>Iftype</b> attribute can be inspected for a text representation
	of the interface type. For a complete list of possibile types see the IFT_*
	variables in net/iftypes.h. Note that the text returned by this attribute
	will not have the IFT_ prefix - i.e. IFT_ETHER is represented simply as
	ETHER.</p>

	<h3>description</h3>

	<p> The <b>description</b> attribute is used both to set and retrieve the
    interface description string. That is, the value assigned to this attribute,
    will automatically be set on the interface as well. </p>

	<h3>mtu</h3>

	<p> The <b>mtu</b> attribute is used both to set and retrieve interface
	MTU. That is, values assigned to this attribute, will automatically be
	set on the interface as well. </p>

	<h3>metric</h3>

	<p> The <b>metric</b> attribute is used both to set and retrieve interface
	metric. That is, values assigned to this attribute, will automatically be
	set on the interface as well. </p>

	<h3>addresses</h3>

	<p> A list of addresses for this interface. The value returned is a list of
	dictionaries, the format of which would be tedious to explain here, but
	should be obvious upon inspection.</p>

	<h3>media</h3>

	<p> The <b>media</b> attribute is used to inspect and manipulate the media
	types and options of an interface. If media options do not apply to an
	interface, the <b>media</b> attribute will be set to None. For more
	information, see the documentation covering the <a
	href="media.html">Media Class</a>.</p>

	<h3>addAddress(addr, mask=None)</h3>

	<p> Add an IPv4 or IPv6 address to the interface. The mask specification is
	optional, and can be given either as a prefix length (i.e. "24"), or as an
	address (i.e. "255.255.255.0"). The default masks are 24 for IPv4 and 64
	for IPv6. IPv6 addresses can make use of all the standard abbreviations and
	notations.</p>

	<h3>delAddress(addr)</h3>

	<p> Delete the specified address from the interface. </p>

	<h3>setAddress(addr, mask=None)</h3>

	<p> Set an address. The arguments are treated identically to those of
	addAddress, but the first existing address of the same type (i.e. IPv4 or
	IPv6) is first removed from the interface.</p>

	<h3>addGroup(groupName)</h3>

    <p> Assign this interface to an interface group </p>

	<h3>delGroup(groupName)</h3>

    <p> Unassign this interface from an interface group it is a part of </p>

	<h3>getGroups()</h3>

    <p> Return a list of interface groups of which this interface is a member </p>
