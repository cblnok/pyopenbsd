<p> All functionality exposed by the ifconfig module is accessed through an
instance of the IFConfig class. This class acts as a dictionary that "contains"
the list of network interfaces. Each interface is an instance of the Interface
class, which is discussed in the next section.</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

	<h3>IFConfig()</h3>

	<p>The IFConfig class requires no instantiation parameters.</p>

	<h3>__getitem__(ifname)</h3>

	<h3>has_key(ifname)</h3>

	<p>Does an interface with the name ifname exist.</p>

	<h3>keys()</h3>

	<p>Retrieve a list of interfaces.</p>

	<h3>create(ifname)</h3>

	<p> Create an interface with name ifname. </p>

	<h3>destroy(ifname)</h3>
