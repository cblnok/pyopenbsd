<p> The <b>netstat</b> module exposes network and protocol information similar
to that made available by the familiar <b>netstat(1)</b> tool. Since it uses
the Kernel Virtual Memory interface (kvm(3)) to read datastructures from kernel
memory, using the <b>netstat</b> module requires root privileges. </p>

<p> Access to data is provided by methods of the Netstat class. Each method
returns a nested set of dictionaries and/or lists, the structure and meaning of
which should be obvious by inspection. It is frequently useful to be able to
refer to the kernel header files where the pertinent data structures are
defined, and the documentation for each Netstat method provides this
information.</p>

<h2> Example </h2>

<p> The following example uses the standard Python pretty-printer to output a
complete set of IP traffic statistics. </p>

	<!--(block example)-->import pprint
import openbsd.netstat

pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
ns = openbsd.netstat.Netstat()
pp.pprint(ns.ipstats())
ns.close()
	<!--(end)-->
