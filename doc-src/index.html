<p> The PyOpenBSD library allows Python programs to interact with the OpenBSD
operating system in a smooth and seamless way. It consists of a set of bindings
for various system libraries, as well as interfaces for inspecting in-kernel
variables using kvm.</p> 


<p> PyOpenBSD also contains some useful functionality not directly or solely
related to OpenBSD. At this stage there are no concrete plans to "spin off"
architecture-independent projects. <p>

<p> At the moment both this manual and PyOpenBSD itself are in the Alpha
development stage. Bug reports and contributions are greatly appreciated. </p>

<h2> Requirements </h2>

<p> This version of PyOpenBSD requires following:

    <ul>
        <li> OpenBSD 3.8 </li>

        <li> Python 2.3 </li>
    </ul>

</p>
