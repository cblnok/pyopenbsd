The unit tests in this directory were written to be run by PyLid: 

    http://www.nullcube.com/software/pylid
    
That said, PyLid is built on the standard Python unit-testing framework, so it
should not be hard to run the tests without it. 

About the test suite:

	- If you see any test failures, please inspect the affected unit test files
	  for configurable parameters, before assuming a bug.
	- Running this test suite as root will test functionality like creating and
	  destroying interfaces, setting interface addresses, inspecting kernel
	  information etc, etc. Do NOT do this on a production system.
