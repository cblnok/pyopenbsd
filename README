Installing PyOpenBSD should be as simple as running the following command as
root:

    python setup.py install

Please also take a moment to run the unit tests, and let us know if you come
accross any failures. The easiest way to do this is to download pylid from the
Nullcube website (www.nullcube.com). Then simply enter the test directory, and
run pylid with no arguments.

If you're feeling adventurous, you can also run these tests as root. In this
case, a number of extra tests for functionality like interface creation and
destruction will be run. Please note that there is a (slight) chance that your
system might need a reboot if things go hideously wrong during these tests, so
don't do this on critical systems.
