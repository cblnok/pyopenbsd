To install, run the following command as root:

    python setup.py install

Please also take a moment to run the unit tests, and notify us of any failures.
To do this, you will need to download the Pry unit testing framework from:
    
    http://dev.nullcube.com
    
If the test suite is run as root, a number of extra tests for functionality
like interface creation and destruction will be run. There is a chance that the
system might need a reboot if things go wrong during these tests, so DO NOT RUN
THE TEST SUITE AS ROOT ON CRITICAL SYSTEMS.
